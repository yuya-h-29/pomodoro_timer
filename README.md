🍅This is a mobile app for simple Pomodoro timer, which is a 25min timer to immerse yourself in the task for 25 minutes. 

🍅Hard to keep your motivation up? Try the random quote generator function!!!!


## Future Features

🍅I'll add if-then schedule for the app, and Pomodoro timer will be uploaded on App Store!!

🍅Look forward　to it !!


## Technologies

### Programming language 

🍅Dart 

### Framework 

🍅Flutter 


### Information

🍅I only had 4 days to learn Dart / flutter from scratch and build this app, so this app is really easy. 

🍅But it was a giant leap for me.

🍅Works on both iOS and Android, but I haven't deployed because I don't have Google play console account and app store acount.
